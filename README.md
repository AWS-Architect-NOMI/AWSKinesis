# AWSKinesis
 IoT Data Processing Pipeline with AWS SageMaker, Kinesis, Glue, Redshift, and QuickSight
Introduction

This project demonstrates how to build a real-time IoT data processing pipeline using AWS services. IoT devices generate massive amounts of data that need to be ingested, processed, transformed, and visualized for insights. By implementing this project, we ensure efficient data ingestion, storage, and visualization.

Architecture Overview

AWS Kinesis Data Streams: Ingests real-time IoT data.

Amazon S3: Stores raw IoT data.

AWS Glue: Transforms and processes data.

Amazon Redshift: Stores structured data for analytics.

Amazon QuickSight: Visualizes the data for insights.

Step-by-Step Implementation

Create a Kinesis Data Stream:

aws kinesis create-stream --stream-name IoTDataStream --shard-count 1

Configure IoT Devices to Send Data to Kinesis:

import boto3
import json
kinesis = boto3.client('kinesis')
data = {'temperature': 25.6, 'humidity': 70, 'device_id': 'sensor-1'}
response = kinesis.put_record(
    StreamName='IoTDataStream',
    Data=json.dumps(data),
    PartitionKey='sensor-1'
)

Store Data in S3:

Use AWS Firehose to stream data from Kinesis to S3.

Transform Data with AWS Glue:

Create a Glue ETL job to process data and store it in Redshift.

Analyze and Visualize Data in QuickSight:

Connect QuickSight to Redshift and create dashboards.

Achievement & Business Use Case

Achievement: Created a real-time IoT data pipeline for analytics.

Use Case: Smart manufacturing, predictive maintenance, and environmental monitoring.
